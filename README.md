# Spot-the-Difference-Game
Identify the difference between similar photos of smiling faces.

## Gameplay
There will be two photos generated, both with smiling faces, however, the picture on the left will have one extre face.<br/>

The objective is simple. Find the extra smiley face and click it.<br/>

Clicking on the correct face will result in a new image of faces which will appear with 5 more faces. This process will repeat. Once the wrong face is clicked, the game ends. Any accidental click on the page that is not the correct face will also be interpreted as wrong, causing the game to end.
